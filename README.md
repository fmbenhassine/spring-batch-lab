# How to checkout a single project folder?

This repository contains dozens of projects and you might want to checkout only a single folder instead of the entire repository. This can be done with the `git sparse-checkout` command. For example, if you want to only checkout the source code of my blog post about running Spring Batch jobs on Kubernetes [here](https://github.com/benas/spring-batch-lab/tree/master/blog/spring-batch-kubernetes), you can run the following commands:

```
$> git clone --sparse --depth 1 https://github.com/benas/spring-batch-lab
$> cd spring-batch-lab
$> git sparse-checkout add blog/spring-batch-kubernetes
```

At this point you, you should only have the source code of that blog post in your clone:

```
